copy paste the python script in your houdini self 
change the directory paths as your pipeline path
Enjoy!

For the Houdini script use your own file system path, to get the data and for the flipbook to mp4 creation make sure you change the ffmpeg installation path of your system, some buttons are indipendent like camera clean, u can delete any extra higherkey or camera u have to mention the name, For setting the file and frame renge make sure your camera path is correct, cause it's breaking the cam anim and output as frame renge, and change the fps according to your project default is 24 , 

thanks and Enjoy
